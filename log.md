# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Setup. Finished up through Responsive Web Design Priniples in [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Starting this on a whim which is probably a bad idea. I am just setting things up which yes I am counting toward the hour. I will also count doing freecodecamp.com and exercism.com curriculum work. I may even split things 50/50. I am also going to let myself skip whatever days I need as long as I get in at least two entries a week (would still be done within a year). Hopefully I don't delete this in shame shortly.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
