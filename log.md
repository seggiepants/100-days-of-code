# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Initial Setup of this log. Finished up through Responsive Web Design Priniples in [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Got my minesweeper code back out and got it handling left and right clicks.

**Thoughts:** Starting this on a whim which is probably a bad idea. I am counting setting things up toward the hour but still went over anyway. I will also count doing freecodecamp.com and exercism.com curriculum work. I may even split things 50/50. I am also going to let myself skip whatever days I need as long as I get in at least two entries a week (would still be done within a year). Hopefully I don't delete this in shame shortly.

### Day 2: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) section on flex-grid on my lunch break. That should leave about a half hour left tonight for regular coding. Spent way too much time beginning to switch settings over to a SQLITE3 database.

**Thoughts**: I sure hope I remember all these new css selectors. I wanted to TDD the SQLITE3 database changes, will have to do that tomorrow I guess. It does seem to be pulling in difficulty definitions but I am not using them yet. Maybe in the final version I will allow custom difficulty levels. Not saving high scores yet, but that should come soon.

### Day 3: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was all [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) stuff. First I did the section on CSS-grid (again I hope I remember things but probably won't). Second I did the first of the course projects, the Tribute page. Mine is for Jack "King" Kirby. You can see it in the [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/seggiepants/full/rNadevO) link below.

**Thoughts**: Yup, I sure forgot a lot of the stuff I thought I might. Still this section is going to be nowhere near 300 hours. Guess I was better than I thought.

### Day 4: January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started work on the survey form, the second [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) responsive web design project. I based it off the [telemarketer counter script](https://egbg.home.xs4all.nl/counterscript.html). Now I want to make it look good. Ooops. It is only part done too. You can take a look at what I have so far.

**Thoughts**: This is starting to grind already. I am always spending too much time to keep this sustainable.

### Day 5: January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work on the survey form, I chose something too big to copy. New today is it has JavaScript functionality to show/hide sections based on answers. The JavaScript needs to be refactored already.

**Thoughts**: Didn't want to do the challenge today, but I did....eventually.

### Day 6: January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have spent too much time on the survey form. I finally have it feature complete and pretty much working. It isn't all that pretty, but then neither was the source inspiration. It is however actually responsive now, using both css-grid and flex selectors. Doesn't look half bad on a phone. I switched from codepen.io to working locally with http-server and Visual Studio Code as I was more comforatable that way. The local web server let me see it run on my phone which is always neat.

**Thoughts**: You would think this would be easier to fit in on a Saturday, but not really. Tomorrow I may detour back to my Minesweeper game for a bit before working on the next Responsive Web Design assignment.

### Day 7: January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I detoured back to my Minesweeper game for a bit. I didn't do my tests yet. However, I did get the settings working like I wanted. I spent a whole lot of time trying to debug a reduce call which was really on in there to say I had map/filter/reduce style functions in the code. I also spent a lot of time struggling against tkinter trying to figure out how to get the radio button style menu items in the difficutly menu to be selected properly (need to create a Tk.IntVar and map it to each item). After that I also struggled a much shorter time in rebuilding the grid on click and now all of the current menu items actually work.

I am still missing:
* Win condition
* Lose condition
* Timing
* High Score Load/Save/View
* Help System
* Getting Sphinx working as desired
* A whole lot of tests
* A whole lot of documentation comments.

I probably spent a lot longer than an hour too, probably at least two hours. I have to stop that if I want this to be sustainable.

**Thoughts**: Sunday was easier to get going on than Saturday. Not too surprising. I got tripped up on things I wasn't expecting to get tripped up on, and I didn't feel smart when I figured out the problems. Probably start on the next Responsive Web Design project tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I mocked up the product landing page form. It really needs some content, images, a video, and some polish but the skeleton in place passes the automated tests.

**Thoughts**: I am wondering if I can draw pictures for the page and call it coding tomorrow. I want a CSS bubble guy waving his arms but that may be too much work.

### Day 9: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I haven't tackled the video yet, but I did get some product images made. I decided the JavaScript was going to largely be review so I did some of that on my phone inbetween things (had to turn off auto-complete on the keyboard or the whole site fails miserably). Finally I spent time trying to get the product area to behave in a reasonable manner.

**Thoughts**: Video may be mostly a cheesy slideshow with a voice over. Don't expect much.

### Day 10: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added a cheesy product video in mp4 and webm formats. I couldn't get ogg to work so it may not work in opera or some browsers with ogg as their only decoder. It was just an intentionally cheesy slideshow. Hopefully that is it for art creation for a while. I don't want to count it then spend even more time on the project. Today that was spent making the page more responsive mobile first and to make things pretty in general. Still more work to do, but I may be close to done on this project.

**Thoughts**: This is cutting into my sleep time, I need to knock that off.

### Day 11: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the product page or at least for now. Started on technical design document. Got the tests passing. Wanted to do a Hamburger menu on mobile and got stuck.

**Thoughts**: Hamburger menu isn't working right may need to consult a different website. No code pen yet.

### Day 12: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: All I got working was the hamburger menu. But it is now my creation instead of just a copy paste from someones blog.

**Thoughts**: Shouldn't have much more to do to the page except add content. So what was I going to technically document now? Still no codepen.io link yet, didn't make one yet. Tomorrow for sure.
