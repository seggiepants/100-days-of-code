# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Initial Setup of this log. Finished up through Responsive Web Design Priniciples in [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Got my minesweeper code back out and got it handling left and right clicks.

**Thoughts:** Starting this on a whim which is probably a bad idea. I am counting setting things up toward the hour but still went over anyway. I will also count doing freecodecamp.com and exercism.com curriculum work. I may even split things 50/50. I am also going to let myself skip whatever days I need as long as I get in at least two entries a week (would still be done within a year). Hopefully I don't delete this in shame shortly.

### Day 2: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) section on flex-grid on my lunch break. That should leave about a half hour left tonight for regular coding. Spent way too much time beginning to switch settings over to a SQLITE3 database.

**Thoughts**: I sure hope I remember all these new css selectors. I wanted to TDD the SQLITE3 database changes, will have to do that tomorrow I guess. It does seem to be pulling in difficulty definitions but I am not using them yet. Maybe in the final version I will allow custom difficulty levels. Not saving high scores yet, but that should come soon.

### Day 3: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was all [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) stuff. First I did the section on CSS-grid (again I hope I remember things but probably won't). Second I did the first of the course projects, the Tribute page. Mine is for Jack "King" Kirby. You can see it in the [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/seggiepants/full/rNadevO) link below.

**Thoughts**: Yup, I sure forgot a lot of the stuff I thought I might. Still this section is going to be nowhere near 300 hours. Guess I was better than I thought.

### Day 4: January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started work on the survey form, the second [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) responsive web design project. I based it off the [telemarketer counter script](https://egbg.home.xs4all.nl/counterscript.html). Now I want to make it look good. Ooops. It is only part done too. You can take a look at what I have so far.

**Thoughts**: This is starting to grind already. I am always spending too much time to keep this sustainable.

### Day 5: January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work on the survey form, I chose something too big to copy. New today is it has JavaScript functionality to show/hide sections based on answers. The JavaScript needs to be refactored already.

**Thoughts**: Didn't want to do the challenge today, but I did....eventually.

### Day 6: January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have spent too much time on the survey form. I finally have it feature complete and pretty much working. It isn't all that pretty, but then neither was the source inspiration. It is however actually responsive now, using both css-grid and flex selectors. Doesn't look half bad on a phone. I switched from codepen.io to working locally with http-server and Visual Studio Code as I was more comforatable that way. The local web server let me see it run on my phone which is always neat.

**Thoughts**: You would think this would be easier to fit in on a Saturday, but not really. Tomorrow I may detour back to my Minesweeper game for a bit before working on the next Responsive Web Design assignment.

### Day 7: January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I detoured back to my Minesweeper game for a bit. I didn't do my tests yet. However, I did get the settings working like I wanted. I spent a whole lot of time trying to debug a reduce call which was really on in there to say I had map/filter/reduce style functions in the code. I also spent a lot of time struggling against tkinter trying to figure out how to get the radio button style menu items in the difficutly menu to be selected properly (need to create a Tk.IntVar and map it to each item). After that I also struggled a much shorter time in rebuilding the grid on click and now all of the current menu items actually work.

I am still missing:
* Win condition
* Lose condition
* Timing
* High Score Load/Save/View
* Help System
* Getting Sphinx working as desired
* A whole lot of tests
* A whole lot of documentation comments.

I probably spent a lot longer than an hour too, probably at least two hours. I have to stop that if I want this to be sustainable.

**Thoughts**: Sunday was easier to get going on than Saturday. Not too surprising. I got tripped up on things I wasn't expecting to get tripped up on, and I didn't feel smart when I figured out the problems. Probably start on the next Responsive Web Design project tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I mocked up the product landing page form. It really needs some content, images, a video, and some polish but the skeleton in place passes the automated tests.

**Thoughts**: I am wondering if I can draw pictures for the page and call it coding tomorrow. I want a CSS bubble guy waving his arms but that may be too much work.

### Day 9: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I haven't tackled the video yet, but I did get some product images made. I decided the JavaScript was going to largely be review so I did some of that on my phone inbetween things (had to turn off auto-complete on the keyboard or the whole site fails miserably). Finally I spent time trying to get the product area to behave in a reasonable manner.

**Thoughts**: Video may be mostly a cheesy slideshow with a voice over. Don't expect much.

### Day 10: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added a cheesy product video in mp4 and webm formats. I couldn't get ogg to work so it may not work in opera or some browsers with ogg as their only decoder. It was just an intentionally cheesy slideshow. Hopefully that is it for art creation for a while. I don't want to count it then spend even more time on the project. Today that was spent making the page more responsive mobile first and to make things pretty in general. Still more work to do, but I may be close to done on this project.

**Thoughts**: This is cutting into my sleep time, I need to knock that off.

### Day 11: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the product page or at least for now. Started on technical design document. Got the tests passing. Wanted to do a Hamburger menu on mobile and got stuck.

**Thoughts**: Hamburger menu isn't working right may need to consult a different website. No code pen yet.

### Day 12: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: All I got working was the hamburger menu. But it is now my creation instead of just a copy paste from someones blog.

**Thoughts**: Shouldn't have much more to do to the page except add content. So what was I going to technically document now? Still no codepen.io link yet, didn't make one yet. Tomorrow for sure.

### Day 13: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got 20 minutes in before life interrupted, will try to get more in tonight. May have to just do some free code camp JavaScript sections on the go and call it good (but it is soooo hard to type on my phone). Anyway, I managed to get a win and lose condition on Minesweeper, no high score or timer stuff yet, but I think that is enough to call it an actual minesweeper game now. When I came back I noticed some game state related issues. I promised yesterday I would finally make a code pen for the Technical Documentation Page so I did that too. After that, I got tired and finished up with some Free Code Camp Javascript coursework.

**Thoughts**: Saying you can't import a module just because there is a syntax error is bad. It should give you and error on the syntax error, not the import, grrr. Since it is technically a game now I should go back and do more exercism python exercises.

### Day 14: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to peek ahead and look at the final projects for Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures. Ended up doing all five even though I am nowhere near done with the materials. Ooops. Guess I feel better about my Javascript competence. Didn't get the certificate yet. Not sure if the intermediate challenges are required or if you have to go through each lesson. Stayed up midnight to 1am so I guess I can take the rest of the day off if desired.

**Thoughts**: Why did I stay up so late?

**Link to work**: None, sorry.

### Day 15: January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finally decided on a topic for my Technical documentation page the Sierpenski triangle. I am planning to have little Javascript canvas toys on it. However, instead of working on it, I finished the [freeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) Basic JavaScript section instead which took the whole hour. I did actually play around on SmileBasic for 3DS yesterday for a while in case you didn't think the 1am posting should count.

**Thoughts**: Bummer I only did the learning stuff. Guess I need to get it out of the way eventually.

**Link to work**: None, sorry.

### Day 16: January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally got to work on the technical documentation page. Looks like I will be swiping a lot of content from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). I am planning to have little javascript canvas objects that render the triangle using each implementation. It may be hard to work in all five required code tag sections.

**Thoughts**: I was rather annoyed to see that the code tag doesn't have preformatted text by default. So I turned it on in the css but for some reason code pen isn't showing it. That makes my python code look awful.

### Day 17: January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Long hard day at work, could only manage some [free code camp](http://freecodecamp.org/learn) Javascript lessons.

**Thoughts**: I was lucky I didn't quit right here.

**Link to work**: None, sorry.

### Day 18: January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got the recursive and chaos game javascript animated canvas elements in (two to go L-System and Arrowhead Curve L-System). Should go back in and make the code prettier.

**Thoughts**: I got the animation to stop unless the element is fully on screen. I am a bit proud of that.

### Day 19: January 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got the lsystem, arrowhead and triangle to tree morph javascript animations working as well as added sample python code for the morph

**Thoughts**: I need to comment and clean up some of the sample code and the javascript code.

### Day 20: January 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I had a hard time getting myself to work on this today, but I finally did. The technical document page is pretty much all laid out now, everything is in it's section and the code and javascript applets are now in the correct place. Just need to enter all the text and pretty it up now.

**Thoughts**: I might take a break and work on a different project tomorrow.

### Day 21: January 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I took a break from the technical document and went back and finished up Mugwump 2D on Fuze4 Nintendo Switch. Glad to get the project off of my back log. It is actually fairly fun, maybe I will port it to SmileBasic 3DS/Switch and JavaScript for the upcoming portfolio page. I also did a few regex lessons on the JavaScript track.


### Day 22: January 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I am feeling very sick so I just did Javascript lessons on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). I made it through regex's which got quite tricky at the end.

**Thoughts**: Never could have done that well on regex a few years ago. Did I get sick from over doing things on 100 days of code?

**Link to work**: (none)


### Day 23: January 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still sick as a dog. Stayed home from work and just layed in bed all day expect for 100 days of code. Anyway, I finally finished up the Technical Design document and I am going to call it good.

**Thoughts**: I wonder what I will finish first the Repsonsive Web Design Section or the JavaScript section.

### Day 24: January 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Can't sleep so I decided to get the 100 Days of Code out of the way. Today I started the personal portfolio. I got the tests passing but it doesn't do much else. I wanted to put my hangman game up on codepen.io, but that would not work, webpack had tendrils too deep.

**Thoughts**: As they say in Dilbert this should be a living document, with items added as I finish projects.

### Day 25: January 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still not sleeping well so I did this in the morning, but hey far more normal a time than yesterday at least. I want my hangman game on my portfolio as it uses WebPack. Unfortunately, There are external file dependencies. I wanted to just pull the files from github like I did for the images on the product page, but CORS reared its ugly head. I tried sending the right CORS headers with no success. Eventually, I disabled the MP3s and loaded the CSV with a Raw-Loader, and it still doesn't work. Am I just chasing my own tail now?

**Thoughts**: I am starting to wonder if codepen.io just won't work with anything generated by webpack. Also my first branch for a project on github so that is a bit of a milestone. Not putting it in the project list pile until it works. All I get is loading...

### Day 26: January 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still not feeling well so you get another morning entry and another dissapointment. Not sure why this Hangman game won't work. Tried to get it debugging under firefox but no real joy. Seemed to create an element and not know if was there. Maybe I need some sort of source map, I don't know. Anyway, I am going to put it away for a while. Finished up with the debugging section of the JavaScript track on [www.freecodecamp.org/learn](htt://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

**Thoughts**: I am already past the 1/4 mark, I can't sit and bang my head against the wall. It took a bit of re-installing some loaders (is that my problem?) but the master branch is running locally again. Maybe I can just deploy it somewhere other than codepen.io. Also Javascript vs. Responsive Web Design which will I finish first!!! 1 project vs. 107 lessons.

### Day 27: February 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: If at first you don't succeed, use a better provider like say your own worpress server. I now have hangman online and working. Was meaining to do that at least a year ago. I am going to delete the code pen reference and replace it with the working one in previous logs. Call it revisionist history if you like, but it looks like I put in a localhost link and that was super dumb.

I also worked on the portfolio page for a bit but it still looks like junk.

After that I got up to 15% in javascript datastructures.

**Thoughts**: Surprised the upload to my personal hosting didn't have any complications. Of course it is just html and javascript no backend stuff. No Hourly Comic Day this year I am too sick it would just be pictures of me lying in be moaning.

### Day 28: February 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still super sick from the flu but I managed to do javascript datastructures on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

**Thoughts**: Really wish this flu would let up, I am going stir crazy just resting in bed.

**Links to work**: (none for today)


### Day 29: February 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: It snowed a bunch and I am still sick so I took another day off. (Hate needing to do that).  Anyway I got through Basic Algorithm Scripting on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). Once I feel better I want to get back to more code. 71 lessons left in javascript.

**Thoughts**: Could have gone a bit faster if I didn't keep trying to use higher order array operations (but I don't regret trying to get a hang of them). Still soooooooo tired. Also a two hour call when you are mid way through is ... unfortunate.

**Links to work**: (none for today)


### Day 30: February 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the object orientation section in javascript. With a few minutes left over poked at the personal portfolio page a bit. No fixes there.

**Thoughts**: Wow! prototype hacking for inheritence is painfully bad. Please tell me there is better class syntax just around the corner. I am pretty sure I have heard of some.

**Links to work**: Too lazy to post a still broken link.

### Day 31: February 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Only looked at functional programming today, didn't get too far.

**Thoughts**: Too tired to put much effort in, sorry. About 31 sections left in the Javascript track.

**Links to work**: None.

### Day 32: February 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished functional started the intermediate challenges got through three of them.

**Thoughts**: I may finally be starting to feel better even if I am still sick. Hope to get enought energy to get back to bigger projects soon.

**Links to work**: None.

### Day 33: February 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: These intermediate challenges are taking forever.

**Thoughts**: Gotta go back and finish the web stuff first, shouldn't I?

**Links to work**: None.

### Day 34: February 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tired of doing just javascript exercises so I went back to my portfolio page some more. It doesn't look broken anymore huzzah.

**Thoughts**: I guess I got lost when I thought project-tile should be project-ti**t**le. Oy. That put me back a lot.

### Day 35: February 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Just played around with Fuze4 on Nintendo Switch while waiting for laundry. Wanted to do depth first search maze generation but something is wrong. Hard to debug with no debugger, read eval print loop or a reasonable console. I will try to fix it later.

**Thoughts**: Wanted to make ghost maze 3d or at least do something with 3d.

**Links to work**: 
(None)

### Day 36: February 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did more Javascript Exercises, got to 67% done.

**Thoughts**: Why are these taking me soooo long.

**Links to work**: 
(None)

### Day 37: February 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the Javascript track on FreeCode camp and got my certification.

**Thoughts**: I had to go find a youtube video to describe how to redeem my certification. Then it wouldn't show it to me until I made my profile public. I had to hunt for the thing. I was expecting a nice popup on completion but nooo, you gotta go find it and redeem it.

**Links to work**: 
(None)

### Day 38: February 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went back and cleaned up the personal portfolio enough to turn in and get the certification.

**Thoughts**: Good enough for now I guess. Should go back and give it more love later.

### Day 39: February 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went back and fixed the maze generation program I started previously on Fuze4 Nintendo Switch.

**Thoughts**: Looks like you can not use recursion much. Ran out of stack space going from a 7x7 maze to a 11x11 maze. Had to make a manual stack to get a bigger maze. Doesn't look like I can dynamically push/pop from an array either. Had to make a width * height array for the manual stack.

**Links to work**:
(None) but there is a picture over on twitter.

### Day 40: February 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Wasn't sure what to do so I started the Front End Library Certification and got through the sections on bootstrap and jQuery. Wasn't expecting to get that far.

**Thoughts**: May have started after midnight, still counting it as day 40 will do more later for day 41.

**Links to work**:
(None)

### Day 41: February 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of time checking in my exercism.io stuff so I could count it as github stuff if I decide to do some during 100 days of code. Then I did the SASS exercises and the first 15 react exercises. The 15th exercise just wouldn't work until I reset the code. I even looked at a hint and didn't see any differences. How annoying.

**Thoughts**: Sure are a lot of spammy things you have to allow to get the thing working, including one identified as a webbug :(

**Links to work**:
[exercism.io](https://github.com/seggiepants/Exercism)

### Day 42: February 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent too much time on things today. I ported my Mugwump_2D program from Fuze4 (Nintendo Switch) to SmileBasic (3DS). That took a lot longer than I expected. Guess I am going to make a copy for everything eventually. Want to make Java and/or Kotlin into an android app.

**Thoughts**: The smile basic api is really neat, didn't have to scream over my code for an hour to get a copy, huzzah.

### Day 43: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I got to 32/47 on the React training on #freeCodeCamp today. I also ported yesterday's SmileBasic 3DS program to SmileBasic on the Switch, the key is: 44J4DB3WD

**Thoughts**: How did I miss making a Life the Universe and Everything reference yesterday? Don't feel like I am retaining much on the React stuff and having to bind this all the time is broken and dumb. Trying to get through all the lessons so I can work on the projects, I think the projects count a lot more.

### Day 44: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished up the React section even though I went a bit over on time.

**Thoughts**: Hope I remember this stuff. Tomorrow I start on Redux I suppose.

**Links to work**:
(none)

### Day 45: February 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished up the Redux section, shoud do the React + Redux section tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I was forgetting stuff before the end of the chapter, the projects are going to be hard.

**Links to work**:
(none)

### Day 46: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the section on React and Redux, tomorrow I can start on the projects. I don't feel like I am actually ready for it.

**Thoughts**: Man this log is getting stupidly long.

**Links to work**:

### Day 47: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started work on the Random Quote Machine. Probably spent too long mining Red Dwarf quotes.

**Thoughts**: Got both less and more done than expected. Strange.

**Links to work**:
[github.com](https://github.com/seggiepants/freecodecamp/tree/master/front%20end%20libraries/random-quote-machine)

### Day 48: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: It isn't pretty, but the quote machine is passing all of the tests now. One small problem with your bind syntax and you are chasing your own tail for quite a long time, uggg.

**Thoughts**: I did steal the twitter intent link off their sample solution, but I made it work my own way. Was surprised the sample solution didn't use ReactJS. I also had to hack it up so you have a different author each time, otherwise I get a failed test.

### Day 49: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent hours making red dwarf character svg files to show who it talking then put them in the code. Still lots of css work to do. I should probably use bootstrap shouldn't I? 

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow is the big half way point.

### Day 50: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added bootstrap but things still won't line up as I like. Turned the quote box into a speech bubble with some css theft.

**Thoughts**: The big half way point.

### Day 51: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Think things look pretty good now. I settled on a vertical column for both desktop and mobile. Now I can't figure out how to get react working on codepen.io

**Thoughts**: The long slog to the finish begins here.

### Day 52: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I got things working on codepen.io. I had to watch videos on how to enable react but it still didn't work right. Eventually banging my head against the wall got something moving. Specifically I needed to copy some code from index.js, get rid of the import react statement and export app statements, then things started to move. After that it took a bit to figure out that codepen.io won't show svg images or at least not ones from github, but maybe I was linking wrong. So back to inkscape, export everything to .png then link in that. Some extra search/replace to change folders and file extensions and suddenly things work. I am now 1 of 5 projects complete. Next is the markdown previewer.

**Thoughts**: CodePen kind of stinks, why can't I have multiple javascript/html/css files? I guess it is only meant for small demos, but still.

### Day 53: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on the markdown previewer, it is going well but I can't seem to get rid of some sizing errors. I want the default text to load from a fetch call too.

**Thoughts**: Adding a bunch of 3rd party components makes things easy.

### Day 54: February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to add a title but failed getting things to size properly, eventually gave up and took it out. Blaming it on the splitter library but I may just not be using it right. Tried to add redux and broke things, I guess I will fix it tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Why, why did I decide to add redux?

### Day 55: February 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got things largely how I want them working locally with redux and what not, but now it won't work on codepen.io. I even tried ripping out the react/redux part (react-redux didn't want to behave) to no avail. Now I just get a blank screen. Can't even just strip it down to hello world. May start the next project tomorrow I am tired of banging my head against the wall on this one.

**Thoughts**: It is a rare leap day!

### Day 56: March 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Basically rewrote the local state version on codepen. It isn't like I wanted but I can't dither over it forever. I submitted it and I am moving on to the drum machine tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Was hard to get myself to edit stuff today.
