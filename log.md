# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Initial Setup of this log. Finished up through Responsive Web Design Priniples in [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Got my minesweeper code back out and got it handling left and right clicks.

**Thoughts:** Starting this on a whim which is probably a bad idea. I am counting setting things up toward the hour but still went over anyway. I will also count doing freecodecamp.com and exercism.com curriculum work. I may even split things 50/50. I am also going to let myself skip whatever days I need as long as I get in at least two entries a week (would still be done within a year). Hopefully I don't delete this in shame shortly.

### Day 2: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) section on flex-grid on my lunch break. That should leave about a half hour left tonight for regular coding. Spent way too much time beginning to switch settings over to a SQLITE3 database.

**Thoughts**: I sure hope I remember all these new css selectors. I wanted to TDD the SQLITE3 database changes, will have to do that tomorrow I guess. It does seem to be pulling in difficulty definitions but I am not using them yet. Maybe in the final version I will allow custom difficulty levels. Not saving high scores yet, but that should come soon.

### Day 3: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was all [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) stuff. First I did the section on CSS-grid (again I hope I remember things but probably won't). Second I did the first of the course projects, the Tribute page. Mine is for Jack "King" Kirby. You can see it in the [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/seggiepants/full/rNadevO) link below.

**Thoughts**: Yup, I sure forgot a lot of the stuff I thought I might. Still this section is going to be nowhere near 300 hours. Guess I was better than I thought.

### Day 4: January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started work on the survey form, the second [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) responsive web design project. I based it off the [telemarketer counter script](https://egbg.home.xs4all.nl/counterscript.html). Now I want to make it look good. Ooops. It is only part done too. You can take a look at what I have so far.

**Thoughts**: This is starting to grind already. I am always spending too much time to keep this sustainable.

### Day 5: January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work on the survey form, I chose something too big to copy. New today is it has JavaScript functionality to show/hide sections based on answers. The JavaScript needs to be refactored already.

**Thoughts**: Didn't want to do the challenge today, but I did....eventually.

### Day 6: January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have spent too much time on the survey form. I finally have it feature complete and pretty much working. It isn't all that pretty, but then neither was the source inspiration. It is however actually responsive now, using both css-grid and flex selectors. Doesn't look half bad on a phone. I switched from codepen.io to working locally with http-server and Visual Studio Code as I was more comforatable that way. The local web server let me see it run on my phone which is always neat.

**Thoughts**: You would think this would be easier to fit in on a Saturday, but not really. Tomorrow I may detour back to my Minesweeper game for a bit before working on the next Responsive Web Design assignment.

### Day 7: January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I detoured back to my Minesweeper game for a bit. I didn't do my tests yet. However, I did get the settings working like I wanted. I spent a whole lot of time trying to debug a reduce call which was really on in there to say I had map/filter/reduce style functions in the code. I also spent a lot of time struggling against tkinter trying to figure out how to get the radio button style menu items in the difficutly menu to be selected properly (need to create a Tk.IntVar and map it to each item). After that I also struggled a much shorter time in rebuilding the grid on click and now all of the current menu items actually work.

I am still missing:
* Win condition
* Lose condition
* Timing
* High Score Load/Save/View
* Help System
* Getting Sphinx working as desired
* A whole lot of tests
* A whole lot of documentation comments.

I probably spent a lot longer than an hour too, probably at least two hours. I have to stop that if I want this to be sustainable.

**Thoughts**: Sunday was easier to get going on than Saturday. Not too surprising. I got tripped up on things I wasn't expecting to get tripped up on, and I didn't feel smart when I figured out the problems. Probably start on the next Responsive Web Design project tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I mocked up the product landing page form. It really needs some content, images, a video, and some polish but the skeleton in place passes the automated tests.

**Thoughts**: I am wondering if I can draw pictures for the page and call it coding tomorrow. I want a CSS bubble guy waving his arms but that may be too much work.

### Day 9: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I haven't tackled the video yet, but I did get some product images made. I decided the JavaScript was going to largely be review so I did some of that on my phone inbetween things (had to turn off auto-complete on the keyboard or the whole site fails miserably). Finally I spent time trying to get the product area to behave in a reasonable manner.

**Thoughts**: Video may be mostly a cheesy slideshow with a voice over. Don't expect much.

### Day 10: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added a cheesy product video in mp4 and webm formats. I couldn't get ogg to work so it may not work in opera or some browsers with ogg as their only decoder. It was just an intentionally cheesy slideshow. Hopefully that is it for art creation for a while. I don't want to count it then spend even more time on the project. Today that was spent making the page more responsive mobile first and to make things pretty in general. Still more work to do, but I may be close to done on this project.

**Thoughts**: This is cutting into my sleep time, I need to knock that off.

### Day 11: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the product page or at least for now. Started on technical design document. Got the tests passing. Wanted to do a Hamburger menu on mobile and got stuck.

**Thoughts**: Hamburger menu isn't working right may need to consult a different website. No code pen yet.

### Day 12: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: All I got working was the hamburger menu. But it is now my creation instead of just a copy paste from someones blog.

**Thoughts**: Shouldn't have much more to do to the page except add content. So what was I going to technically document now? Still no codepen.io link yet, didn't make one yet. Tomorrow for sure.

### Day 13: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got 20 minutes in before life interrupted, will try to get more in tonight. May have to just do some free code camp JavaScript sections on the go and call it good (but it is soooo hard to type on my phone). Anyway, I managed to get a win and lose condition on Minesweeper, no high score or timer stuff yet, but I think that is enough to call it an actual minesweeper game now. When I came back I noticed some game state related issues. I promised yesterday I would finally make a code pen for the Technical Documentation Page so I did that too. After that, I got tired and finished up with some Free Code Camp Javascript coursework.

**Thoughts**: Saying you can't import a module just because there is a syntax error is bad. It should give you and error on the syntax error, not the import, grrr. Since it is technically a game now I should go back and do more exercism python exercises.

### Day 14: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to peek ahead and look at the final projects for Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures. Ended up doing all five even though I am nowhere near done with the materials. Ooops. Guess I feel better about my Javascript competence. Didn't get the certificate yet. Not sure if the intermediate challenges are required or if you have to go through each lesson. Stayed up midnight to 1am so I guess I can take the rest of the day off if desired.

**Thoughts**: Why did I stay up so late?

**Link to work**: None, sorry.

### Day 15: January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finally decided on a topic for my Technical documentation page the Sierpenski triangle. I am planning to have little Javascript canvas toys on it. However, instead of working on it, I finished the [freeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) Basic JavaScript section instead which took the whole hour. I did actually play around on SmileBasic for 3DS yesterday for a while in case you didn't think the 1am posting should count.

**Thoughts**: Bummer I only did the learning stuff. Guess I need to get it out of the way eventually.

**Link to work**: None, sorry.

### Day 16: January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally got to work on the technical documentation page. Looks like I will be swiping a lot of content from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). I am planning to have little javascript canvas objects that render the triangle using each implementation. It may be hard to work in all five required code tag sections.

**Thoughts**: I was rather annoyed to see that the code tag doesn't have preformatted text by default. So I turned it on in the css but for some reason code pen isn't showing it. That makes my python code look awful.

### Day 17: January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Long hard day at work, could only manage some [free code camp](http://freecodecamp.org/learn) Javascript lessons.

**Thoughts**: I was lucky I didn't quit right here.

**Link to work**: None, sorry.

### Day N: Month Day, 2020
