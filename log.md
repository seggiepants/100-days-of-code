# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Initial Setup of this log. Finished up through Responsive Web Design Priniples in [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Got my minesweeper code back out and got it handling left and right clicks.

**Thoughts:** Starting this on a whim which is probably a bad idea. I am counting setting things up toward the hour but still went over anyway. I will also count doing freecodecamp.com and exercism.com curriculum work. I may even split things 50/50. I am also going to let myself skip whatever days I need as long as I get in at least two entries a week (would still be done within a year). Hopefully I don't delete this in shame shortly.

### Day 2: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.frecodecamp.org) section on flex-grid on my lunch break. That should leave about a half hour left tonight for regular coding.

**Thoughts**: I sure hope I remember all these new css selectors.
