# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Initial Setup of this log. Finished up through Responsive Web Design Priniples in [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Got my minesweeper code back out and got it handling left and right clicks.

**Thoughts:** Starting this on a whim which is probably a bad idea. I am counting setting things up toward the hour but still went over anyway. I will also count doing freecodecamp.com and exercism.com curriculum work. I may even split things 50/50. I am also going to let myself skip whatever days I need as long as I get in at least two entries a week (would still be done within a year). Hopefully I don't delete this in shame shortly.

### Day 2: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) section on flex-grid on my lunch break. That should leave about a half hour left tonight for regular coding. Spent way too much time beginning to switch settings over to a SQLITE3 database.

**Thoughts**: I sure hope I remember all these new css selectors. I wanted to TDD the SQLITE3 database changes, will have to do that tomorrow I guess. It does seem to be pulling in difficulty definitions but I am not using them yet. Maybe in the final version I will allow custom difficulty levels. Not saving high scores yet, but that should come soon.

### Day 3: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was all [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) stuff. First I did the section on CSS-grid (again I hope I remember things but probably won't). Second I did the first of the course projects, the Tribute page. Mine is for Jack "King" Kirby. You can see it in the [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/seggiepants/full/rNadevO) link below.

**Thoughts**: Yup, I sure forgot a lot of the stuff I thought I might. Still this section is going to be nowhere near 300 hours. Guess I was better than I thought.
